TITLE: The Cave of Riddles
COURSE NUMBER: CS110 with Steven Moore, Fall Semester
Project Overview: An interactive game in which players will have to solve a series of riddles in order to escape the cave. Each riddle has three choices and the player will have unlimited attempts per riddle. If the player chooses the right answer, they will proceed to the next riddle. If they get it wrong, a tally is added to a counter which tells the player how many incorrect choices they made.
ADDITIONAL MODULES: None used.

ATP:
1) Test whether pressing any key on the start screen allows the user to proceed
   Steps: Try every key on the keyboard and see if the game proceeds
   Expected Result: Every key works to proceed the game

2) Test whether the highlight on the choice buttons work correctly
   Steps: Hover over each choice button and see the color change
   Expected Result: Hovering over a choice changes the color of a box to a cyan

3) Test whether selecting the right choice leads to the next riddle
   Steps: Input the correct choices
   Expected Result: Selecting the correct choices proceeds the game to the next screen

4) Test whether the tally functionality is working correctly
   Steps: Input incorrect choices, and take note of how many times they were selected
   Expected Result: The counter should display the correct number of incorrect choices
